Head to a very tiny river to catch some fish! 

Hold A to power up your cast. Release with good timing to catch a bigger fish!

Wait for a bite, and when you see !!!, press A to catch the fish!

In the settings menu, you can view your fishing records, replay the tutorial, turn sounds on and off, and clear your save data. 

In this demo, you can only visit the river, and you can only catch one type of generic fish. 

A future version might have more locations and more species of fish.
