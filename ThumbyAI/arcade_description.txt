A Celsius-to-Fahrenheit AI Demo

This little demo showcases a simple neural network 
designed to learn and predict Fahrenheit values 
from Celsius inputs. The network consists of 1 input, 
5 hidden neurons with sigmoid activation, and 1 
linear output. Training occurs over 500 epochs on a 
dataset of Celsius-to-Fahrenheit pairs (0-100Â°C in 
steps of 5), normalized for the sigmoid function. 
After training, the network's predictions, weights, 
and biases are displayed. Predictions should
approach real-world values, but will vary greatly in 
accuracy as this is a very simple neural net with 
training parameters limited for the sake of time
and clear readability.

A compact and interactive introduction to neural 
networks, intended to be used for both fun and 
education for anyone interested in exploring the 
basics of neural networks and AI. A perfect project
for Thumby! Try giving it new datasets to learn 
something different, or see if you can increase it's 
accuracy by changing the number of epochs or altering 
the training rate (can drastically increase training 
time which is about 20 seconds using default parameters).
Maybe add a new layer of neurons or use a different
function besides sigmoid (ReLU, Tanh, Softmax, etc.).
There are lot's of possibilities here. Have fun!

Features include:

A fancy training screen that says "Please Wait" 
so you know it's not frozen (a feature requested 
by my very patient and helpful playtester <3).

A brief explanation of the network structure and 
training process.

A scrollable results page showing predictions and 
final network parameters.
